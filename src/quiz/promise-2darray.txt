- Extract the code in the setTimeout function and replace the setTimeout function  with the extracted code. Then run the main script. 
- Is there a difference in the flow of execution from when the code was in the setTimeout function?

There is a difference between flow of execution with and without the setTimeout function. With setTimeout,
the console log of the promise status is printed first, then the results of the promise are printed.
Without set timeout, the results of the promises are printed first, then the state of the Promise.
For example with setTimeout, sumPromise1 with print sumPromise1: Promise { <pending> } first then
it will calculate the sum. Without setTimeout, it will calculate the sum first then print
sumPromise1: Promise { 45 }, meaning the promise has been resolved.  This means with setTimeout the
entire script will run first, then it will run the promise code once the end of the main script.
Without the setTimeout, the promises will not be handled after the main script has ended.

- Is the flow of execution in both these examples different from the flow of execution with the examples using the fetch() API, which also returns a promise?


- If yes, explain the code execution difference. Add your explanation to this file.
